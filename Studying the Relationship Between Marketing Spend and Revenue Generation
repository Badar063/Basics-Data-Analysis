Explanation of Code
ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Simulated Dataset
We create a simple dataset of monthly marketing spend and corresponding sales revenue. This can be easily replaced with real data from Google Ads, Meta Ads, HubSpot, or sales logs.
________________________________________
ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Scatter Plot + Regression Line
This visualization shows the relationship between spend and revenue. The regression line helps identify trends:
â€¢	A steep, upward slope suggests a strong positive relationship.
â€¢	Flat or downward slope implies poor marketing effectiveness.
________________________________________
ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Correlation Analysis
A Pearson correlation value close to +1 indicates a strong positive relationship, meaning more spend tends to generate more revenue.
________________________________________
ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Linear Regression Modeling
We fit a regression model to predict revenue based on spend.
â€¢	You can use this for budgeting future campaigns.
â€¢	For example, if you plan to spend Â£22,000 on marketing, the model predicts how much revenue you can expect.

ðŸ“ˆ Insights & Business Impact
Insight	Action
Strong Positive Correlation	Maintain or increase marketing budget
Weak Correlation	Investigate campaign quality or channel effectiveness
Diminishing Returns Observed	Reallocate to high-ROI platforms or optimize campaign targeting
Predictable Spend-to-Revenue	Use model to forecast outcomes and justify investments

âœ… Benefits of This Analysis
â€¢	Prove or improve the effectiveness of your marketing strategy
â€¢	Reduce wasteful spending
â€¢	Help forecast future revenue based on planned budgets
â€¢	Justify increased investment in successful channels

ðŸ“¦ Extend This With:
â€¢	Multiple marketing channels (TV, Digital, Print, Social)
â€¢	ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) per platform
â€¢	Time series analysis to track performance over time
â€¢	A/B test data to isolate campaign impact
