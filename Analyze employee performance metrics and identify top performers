Explanation of Code
üîπ Step 1: Dataset Creation
The dataset includes key performance fields such as:
‚Ä¢	Sales Closed
‚Ä¢	Revenue Generated
‚Ä¢	Customer Satisfaction
‚Ä¢	Tasks Completed
These metrics can come from CRMs, helpdesk systems, or manual tracking.
________________________________________
üîπ Step 2: Employee Classification
We use a rule-based system to classify employees into:
‚Ä¢	Top Performer: High sales, revenue, and customer rating
‚Ä¢	Mid Performer: Moderate results, acceptable satisfaction
‚Ä¢	Needs Improvement: Lagging in most or all metrics
This can be expanded with weighted scoring or machine learning models for larger datasets.
________________________________________
üîπ Step 3: Segment Summary
A summary table shows average KPIs by performance level, helping managers benchmark and set goals for each group.
________________________________________
üîπ Step 4: Visualization
The scatter plot shows:
‚Ä¢	Sales Closed vs Revenue
‚Ä¢	Bubble size = CSAT
‚Ä¢	Color = Performance Level
This visual quickly reveals who performs best in both volume and quality.

üèÜ Insights & Recommendations
Segment	Behavior Summary	Action Plan
Top Performers	Consistent, high-impact employees	Recognize, reward, and retain
Mid Performers	Potential to grow with training or motivation	Offer coaching, incentives, stretch goals
Needs Improvement	Struggle with volume, quality, or reliability	Identify gaps, provide support or reassign roles
